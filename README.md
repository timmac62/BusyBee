This is a very simple (even so I am becoming a Python Master :-)) implementation utilizing CircuitPy. It uses the slide switch as input to set the Do Not Disturb mode either ON (Flash the NeoPixels RED) or OFF.

## Installation

See the [Install or Update Circuit Python](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart) quickstart!

They recommend using Mu, but I prefer VSCode and copying my busyBee.py to CIRCUITPY/code.py.
I wrote updateACE.py to automate this.

```sh
./updateACE.py
```

## Usage example

Extremely simple - merely slide the D7 switch to the left (with the USB oriented in a North fashion).

## Development setup

Describe how to install all development dependencies and how to run an automated test-suite of some kind. Potentially do this for multiple platforms.

```sh
make install
npm test
```

## Release History
